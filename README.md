You will productionize an app, taking it from a functional state to a production-ready state. This will involve finding and handling error cases, adding accessibility features, allowing for localization, adding a widget, and adding a library.

As a working Android developer, you often have to create and implement apps where you are responsible for designing and planning the steps you need to take to create a production-ready app. Unlike Popular Movies where we gave you an implementation guide, it will be up to you to figure things out for the Baking App.

* Used Fragments to support responsive design that works on phones and tablets
* Implemented Espresso to test aspects of the UI
* Used a database that allows users to create their own shopping list to make sure that they get the right ingredients

## Build It Bigger - [Joke Telling App](https://github.com/sooshin/android-joke-telling-app)

<img align="right" src="https://github.com/sooshin/android-joke-telling-app/blob/master/app/src/main/res/mipmap-xxhdpi/ic_launcher.png">

Created a **Joke Telling App** with multiple flavors that uses multiple libraries and Google Cloud Endpoints. This app consists of four modules. A Java library that provides jokes, a Google Cloud Endpoints (GCE) project that serves those jokes, an Android Library containing an activity for displaying jokes, and an Android app that fetches jokes from the GCE module and passes them to the Android Library for display.

* Built app with a free ad-supported version and a paid version
* Retrieved jokes from Google Cloud Endpoints module and displayed them via an Activity from the Android Library.
* Made the free app variant display interstitial ads

## Make Your App Material - [XYZ Reader](https://github.com/sooshin/android-xyz-reader)

In this project, you will redesign an app to follow the Material Design guidelines and translate a set of static design mocks to a living and breathing app. 

This project gives you an opportunity to improve an appâ€™s design, a vital skill for building apps users will love. It also replicates a common developer task of updating and changing an app's design as new standards are released.

* Applied Material Design guidelines to a mobile application
* Implemented the Shared Element Transition in the case using a ViewPager and Fragments
* Customized the animation using PageTransformer. Showed a Snackbar with a button that allows to perform an action
* Created a custom ThreeTwoImageView to make all the images have the same proportion

Building a layout and populating its fields from data received as JSON is a common task for Android Developers. Although JSON parsing is usually done using libraries, writing the JSON parsing for this project will help you to better understand how it is processed.

* Practiced JSON parsing to a model object
* Designed an activity layout
* Populated all fields in the layout accordingly
